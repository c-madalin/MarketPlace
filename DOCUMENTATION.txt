Authentication & Registration:

- The "Keep me signed in" feature works using SharedPreferences.

Main App Feed:
- Main screen (ApplicationFragment) displays the title "REUSEIT" and a scrollable feed of posts (RecyclerView).
- A button allows users to navigate to a screen for creating new posts.

Post Creation:
- AddPostFragment allows users to:
  - enter a post title
  - optionally take a picture using the device camera
  - save the post in the local Room database
- Posts can be created with or without an image.

Local Storage:
- All user data and posts are stored locally on the device.
- No internet or Firebase connection is required.

Problems Encountered & Solutions:

1. Navigation error to AddPostFragment:
   - Cause: AddPostFragment was incorrectly placed inside another fragment in the navigation graph.
   - Solution: Moved it outside and reconnected action properly.

2. App crashed after adding PostEntity:
   - Cause: Database version was not updated.
   - Solution: Updated version to 2 in AppDatabase and added fallbackToDestructiveMigration(true).

3. Post creation required a picture:
   - Cause: Code logic required imagePath to be non-null.
   - Solution: Allowed empty imagePath if user posts without a picture.

4. Post layout height was too large without image:
   - Solution: ImageView visibility set to GONE if no image exists.

Current Status:
- App supports account creation and login
- Users can post messages with or without pictures
- All posts are visible in a scrollable feed
- All data is saved locally; the app works fully offline
