# MarketPlace
Our project is an online marketplace for buying and selling second-hand PC and laptop components, all tested and verified to ensure quality and reliability.
The app will allow users to sign up and log in via email, Google, or Facebook, create a personalized profile with reviews, and easily list, edit, or remove their products.
Buyers will be able to search and filter products, chat directly with sellers, and receive push notifications for offers and messages.
To keep the marketplace safe and trustworthy, we’ll implement a feedback and rating system.
In the future, we’re considering integrating a secure online payment solution for direct transactions.
